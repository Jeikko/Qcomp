# Qcomp
Training on quantum registers

Some exercises to help me understand quantum computing

v1: implement a quantum register and some gate methods, use it to implement the quantum part of Shor's algorithm

Libraries
bit_ops: bitwise operations on numbers. Used to manipulate the register indices
cont_frac: turn a number into a fraction using the continued fraction algorithm
